          <p> This is a story of a warrior she comes from the future to save humanity. She is the last of her kind and wonders the earth alone. She was sent here by God to slay the last of the Dragons.  She will not stop until the last dragon is slain. For they have harvested on humanity for too long. Their reign is ending. The world is not what they told then it was she knows there are many who will not take the news easy the energy they will cause is food for the Dragon and she knows that is when they will cross over to the place humanity has been living for thousands of years. She knows she has to prepare for them for they are hungry.</p>
